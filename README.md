### Scalability
  - Vertical scaling
  - Horizontal scaling

We would introduce Scalability concept by Pizza restaurant, WoW I LIKE IT SO MUCH.

Assume in this restaurant there are one chief to preparing pizaa, when we opend this restaurant there are 5 customer come per hour and chief is enable to serve them

but after month there are 30 cutomer come per hour and chief is not able to serve all these orders so manager decided to hire another 2 chief <br>
but after two weeks there are 70 customer come per hour and manager manager decided to hire another 2 chief <br>
but ... <br>
and so on.

**this solution called Vertical scaling.**

But if manager decided to **open another restaurant** to handle number of customers **this solution called Horizontal scaling.**

Purpose of Scalability handling huge number of orders.
