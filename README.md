# System Design
Systems design a procedure by which we define the architecture of a system to satisfy given requirements. It is a technique by which the required amounts of scalability, reliability, performance and consistency are satisfied in real world systems.

We discuss how to start with system design and why it is required ?

1. Scalability

We would introcuce Scalability concept by Pizza restaurant, WoW I LIKE IT SO MUCH.

Assume in this restaurant there are one cheif to preparing pizaa, when we opend this restaurant there are 5 customer come per hour and cheif is enable to serve them

but after month there are 30 cutomer come per hour and cheif is not able to serve all these orders so manager decided to hire another 2 cheif <br>
but after two weeks there are 70 customer come per hour and manager manager decided to hire another 2 cheif <br>
but ... <br>
and so on

**this called Vertical scaling.**

But if manager decided to **open another restaurant** to handle number of customers **this called Horizontal scaling.**
